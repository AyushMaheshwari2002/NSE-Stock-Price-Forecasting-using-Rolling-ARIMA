# NSE-Stock-Price-Forecasting-using-Rolling-ARIMA


The implementation of ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and rolling ARIMA techniques played a pivotal role in forecasting the forthcoming stock market prices. This approach involved analyzing historical price data, identifying patterns, and incorporating time series analysis to make predictions.

The model was specifically applied to multiple stocks, including Infosys, Tata Steel, TCS, Reliance, and Asian Paints. Each stock's unique historical data was considered individually to capture specific market dynamics and trends.

To assess the performance of the model, the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric was employed. The average RMSE of 34 was obtained, indicating the model's ability to accurately predict future stock prices. Lower RMSE values signify a closer fit between the predicted and actual prices, implying a higher level of accuracy in the model's forecasts.

It's worth mentioning that ARIMA models are widely utilized in financial forecasting due to their ability to capture both short-term and long-term trends, as well as their capacity to handle non-stationary time series data through differencing. By incorporating rolling ARIMA, the model dynamically adapts to changing market conditions and captures evolving patterns, thereby enhancing the accuracy of predictions.

Overall, the implementation of ARIMA and rolling ARIMA techniques on various stocks resulted in a robust forecasting model, with an average RMSE of 34 indicating its efficiency in predicting future stock market prices.
